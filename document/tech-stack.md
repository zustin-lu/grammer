We focus on Frontend development, so it would be reasonable to find a fast and sustain service for BE to develop things faster.

## Database service

After researched on https://bestofjs.org about trending and trustable libraries / services.

I would like to try with **Supabase** because some of these reasons:

- Good reviews / feedbacks from community.
- Has realtime db supported.
- Based on Relational Database | PostgreSQL (Suitable for large application scaling).
- Support edge-function (nice to have).
- Self hosting.
